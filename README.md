## Description

In this tutorial we provide three notebooks for particle characterization in the following regimes: Quantitative Field Imaging, Darkfield Microscopy, and ISCAT(Interferometric Scattering Microscopy). See the following notebooks:

* `ISCAT_analysis`: Analyzing particles imaged in ISCAT.
* `Quantitative_field_analysis`: Analyzing particles imaged in Quantitative Field Imaging. 
* `Darkfield_analysis`: Analyzing particles imaged in Darkfield Microscopy.


## Dependencies

To run notebook please install (https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/deeptrack) and its following dependencies.


## Usage

The notebooks provided are fully ready to use and will run without any modification. Each modality comes with an "experimental" frame located in the data folder, which is meant to give users a basic idea of how to work with their own data and perform analysis.

Using Your Own Data
To use this code with your own data:

Load your custom experimental frame into the project.
Retrain the models using parameters that suit your specific experimental setup.
This flexible approach allows for easy adaptation of the existing code to your unique dataset and requirements.
