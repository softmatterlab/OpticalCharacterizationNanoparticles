"""
Efficient Python implementation of Radial Variance Transform.

The main function is :func:`rvt` in the bottom of the file, which applies the transform to a single image (2D numpy array).


Compared to the vanilla convolution implementation, there are two speed-ups:
1) Pre-calculating and caching kernel FFT; this way so only one inverse FFT is calculated per convolution + one direct fft of the image is used for all convolutions
2) When finding MoV, calculate ``np.mean(rsqmeans)`` in a single convolution by averaging all kernels first
